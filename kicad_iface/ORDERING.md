# Interface board ordering notes

I ordered this from JLCPCB with great success, and with the following non-default parameters:

- Impedance controlled: Yes
- Stackup: JLC7628
- Assembly: Yes
- Economic assembly (standard works but is more costly)

You might need standard assembly if you want JLC to solder the headers for you. Important to note that the headers (only the 2mm pitch ones, not the terminal block) are placed on the back side of the PCB.
